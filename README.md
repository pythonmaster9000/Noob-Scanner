# Noob-Scanner
Personal memory scanner project in c++

Select a new scan and input the PID, data type and value.

Select compare to compare the addresses matched in new scan with a new value. This generates a list of matching values for change addresses function. (if you just want to use change address on all of new scans matches just input the same value you originally gave)

Select change addresses to change all addresses in the list to whatever value you input. 


This is not meant to be used by people and was just for learning purposes also comparing string values doesn't work right now cause lazy.
