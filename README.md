# Noob-Scanner
Personal memory scanner/writer project built as my first c++ project for learning purposes. 

This is not meant to be used by people and was just for learning purposes, also comparing string values and manual address value changing other than doubles is incomplete.

HOWTO:

  Select new scan, input PID, type of data (currently only a few) and value to search for.
  
  Select compare, input the changed value to look for.
  
  To change address values select change all matches, choose manual to copypaste 1 of the addresses or just change the entire list.
